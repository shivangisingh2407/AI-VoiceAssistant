# JARVIS (Just a Rather Very Intelligent System)

#### This was my attempt to make a voice assistant similar to JARVIS (in iron man movie)
#### Let's be honest, it's not as intelligent as in the movie, but it can do a lot of cool things and automate your daily tasks you do on your personal computers/laptops.

It can do a lot of cool things, some of them being:

- Greet user
- Tell current time and date
- Open  websites
- Tells about weather of any city
- Tells about your upcoming events (Google Calendar)
- Tells about any person (via Wikipedia)
- Can search anything on Google 
- Can play any song on YouTube
- Tells top headlines (via Times of India)
- Plays music
- Send email (with subject and content)
- Calculate any mathematical expression (example: Jarvis, calculate x + 135 - 234 = 345)
- Answer any generic question (via Wolframalpha)
- Take important note in notepad
- Tells a random joke
- Tells your IP address
- Can switch the window
- Can take screenshot and save it with custom filename
- Can hide all files in a folder and also make them visible again
- Has a cool Graphical User Interface
- Take images, apply filter and save in a folder


## Future Improvements
- Generalized conversations can be made possible by incorporating Natural Language Processing
- GUI can be made more nicer to look at and functional
- More functionalities can be added
